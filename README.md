## Demo

The following instance of Netlify Redirector will redirect all traffic to `https://github.com/`.

[netlify-redirector-demo.netlify.app/justinmahar/netlify-redirector](https://netlify-redirector-demo.netlify.app/justinmahar/netlify-redirector)

If the redirect is successful, the path will be preserved and you will be sent to the Netlify Redirector project repo. üëç
