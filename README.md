## Demo

### Redirect Demo

The following instance of Netlify Redirector will redirect all traffic to `https://github.com/`. 

Click the link below to see redirects in action:

[https://netlify-redirector-demo.netlify.app/justinmahar/netlify-redirector](https://netlify-redirector-demo.netlify.app/justinmahar/netlify-redirector)

If the redirect is successful, the path is preserved and you will be redirected to the Netlify Redirector project repo. üëç

Try changing the path to your own GitHub if you'd like to try it out.

> Note: The redirect being used by this deploy is: `/* https://github.com/:splat 301!`

### Setup Page Demo

The following setup page will be visible when you first deploy Netlify Redirector:

- [View Default Setup Page](https://netlify-redirector.netlify.app/)

## Setup

### 1. Deploy To Netlify

First, click this button to start a new deploy of Netlify Redirector:

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/justinmahar/netlify-redirector)

Alternatively, you can fork the repo and deploy manually:

<a href="https://github.com/justinmahar/netlify-redirector/fork">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Fork%20this%20repo-brightgreen"/>
</a>

### 2. Open The Site & Configure Redirects

Open the site and follow the instructions to configure your redirects.

As an example, the following redirect will permanently send all traffic to the domain `example.com`:

```
/* https://example.com/:splat 301!
```

You can change `example.com` to your own domain to achieve the same behavior.

### 3. Save Redirects In Netlify

Copy the value from the setup page and save as the environment variable `REDIRECTS` for your site in Netlify via the site settings.

Then trigger a deploy.

Your redirects are now active!

### 4. Add Domain To Site

You can now add your old domain to the deployed Netlify Redirector site via Netlify. All traffic to the old domain will now redirect to the new one.
